I am a second-year master's student at Xidian University, advised by Prof. De Cheng and Prof. Nannan Wang. Prior to this, I received my bachelor degree in Aerospace Science and Technology in 2023. My research interests are in computer vision and multi-modal learning, with specific interest in person re-identification, continual learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, noisy label learning, etc.
